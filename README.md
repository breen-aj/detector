# detector
This repository contains matlab code for sophisticated multimetric APT detector mapping. The code has been built and tested on MATLAB R2020a

Please refer to the following journal article for details:

*under review - will be updated shorty

Please cite this article if you use the code for any presented/published works.

#How to use the code

Download the repository and add the code to your read path in MATLAB.

For mapping density, electric field distribution, distance between successive evaporation events and multiple hits open the main script: 'APT_DETECT_GITHUB.m' in the editor. Have the .epos file of the dataset of interest in the working path. 

Some example data of an additively manufactured Ni based superalloy (Inconel 738) can be found here:
